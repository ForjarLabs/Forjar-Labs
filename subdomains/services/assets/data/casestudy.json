          "LD Photos is run by two brothers in Nigeria with a real knack for visual storytelling. Their shoots had that cinematic, frame-worthy quality that makes you think 'I need these guys at my wedding' but their booking process told a very different story.",
          "Everything lived in their DMs. Instagram. WhatsApp. Facebook. People would send a 'Hi, are you available this Saturday?' message, wait hours for a reply, then maybe come back to confirm days later.",
          "If you have ever run a service-based business, you know that time kills deals. The longer it takes for someone to go from 'I’m interested' to 'I’ve booked,' the higher the odds they disappear. LD Photos was living that problem every week."

        "problemStatement": "The main challenge was the absence of a central booking flow, with all requests scattered across messages on different platforms, making it easy for leads to get lost. LD Photos also had no website before we stepped in, which meant they had no dedicated space to showcase their work, list services, or guide clients toward booking. On top of that, the lead-to-booking process was slow, as clients had to wait for manual replies before confirming a date, giving competitors a window to secure those opportunities instead."
